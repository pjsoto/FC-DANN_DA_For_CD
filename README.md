# FC-DANN_DA_For_CD (Fully Convolutional DANN Domain Adaptation for Change Detection)
The current project contains the code to perform Domain Adaptation based on Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) [1] for change detection in remote sensing images adapted to a fully convolutional scheme, specifically for deforestation detection in tropical forests such as the Amazon rainforest and the Brazilian savannah.

# Prerequisites
1- Python 3.7.4

2- Tensorflow 1.14

# Dataset
Such implementation has been evaluated in a change detection task, namely deforestation detection, and aiming at reproducing the results obtained in [2] and [3] we make available the images used in this project which can be found in the following links for the [Amazon Biome](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V4UdYors3m3eXaAHXgzPc99esjQOc3mq?usp=sharing) as well as for the [Cerrado](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14Jsw0LRcwifwBSPgFm1bZeDBQvewI8NC?usp=sharing).
